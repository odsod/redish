Lab 3: Part I
=============

What package have you chosen?
-----------------------------

We have chosen the package `redish`. It is a simplified Haskell 
implementation of the distributed key-value storage server Redis 
(http://redis.io/).

Source of redish: http://github.com/honza/redish

Why have you chosen this package?
---------------------------------

First of all, we see a lot of potential for improvement in this package.
There is a lot of functionality from Redis, which we believe that we can
realistically port into the Haskell version. 

Also, the Haskell package makes use of the STM monad, and having read
through some of the material published by Simon Peyton Jones, we are excited
to dig deeper into the capabilities of this programming style for
concurrent applications. First and foremost, we hope to gain a better 
understanding of the concepts described in the paper `Composable Memory
Transactions` (http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/stm/stm.pdf).

What do you intend to do for part II?
-------------------------------------

First of all, we intend to separate the logic of the application into
purely functional code, where all logic is modeled as composable 
computations in the STM-monad.

After this is completed, we hope to write a property-based test suite for
the module in QuickCheck. Since the only way of running computations in
the STM-monad is through the run function `atomically`, which results in
IO-computations, we hope to rely on the paper `Testing Monadic Code with QuickCheck` 
(http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.118.9528&rep=rep1&type=pdf) 
to make this work.

After the separation of logic from IO has been made, and an accompanying
test suite has been implemented. We will choose one or two pieces of
functionality from Redis, port these into Redish, and write property-based
tests for this new functionality also.

Which learning outcomes does it relate to?
------------------------------------------

* "Types.HOT: functors, monads and monad transformers"
    - understanding STM; how it works and should be used.

* "Spec.Test: formulate and test properties about the program"
    - QuickCheck testing
